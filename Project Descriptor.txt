Official Technical Implementation Requirements

The script is fully functional, optimised and exceeds expectations for performance and efficiency. It demonstrates advanced algorithmic skills
optimally implementing the sorting algorithm and handling large datasets.

The sorting process is fully dynamic, adjusting effectively to varying user preferences and engagement metrics. The implementation is highly efficient in terms of time 
and space complexity and handles edge cases seamlessly.



Official Critical Evaluation Requirements

The evaluation provides a deep and insightful analysis of design decisions. It demonstrates a thorough understanding of algorithmic choices and justifies decisions based on performance 
reliability and security. There is a clear and critical reflection on how industry trends and innovations could affect the algorithm's future improvements and considers the broader
ethical implications, especially regarding biases in content sorting.


Written Report Requirements

The report is exceptionally clear, well-organised and professional. Language is precise, technical and fully appropriate for the subject matter. The report is free of errors and present 
a cherent, structured argument. Extensive properly cited references to authoritative sources are included and all sections are thoroughly developed with excellent attention to detail.
